    "### Notes:\n",
    "1. **Relative Path**: Use relative paths (e.g., `../folder/file.md`) or absolute paths depending on your project structure.\n",
    "2. **MyST Parser**: Ensure that MyST is properly configured in your environment (e.g., in `conf.py` for Sphinx or `_config.yml` for Jupyter Book).\n",
    "3. **Customization**: You can add options like `start-after` or `end-before` to include only specific parts of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "If you have a file named `smallexample.md` and you want to include it in your current Markdown file, you would write:\n",
    "\n",
    "````{include}smallexample.md````\n",
    "\n",
    "And the output would be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{include} smallexample.md\n",
    "\n"
